  <h1 style="text-align:center"> <u>Thoughts on Tomboys</u> </h1>
  <br><br>
  <p>This was actually a question on <a href="http://www.quora.com/Girls-and-Young-Women/Why-do-girls-who-are-younger-siblings-single-child-tend-to-refer-to-themselves-as-boys-when-talking-to-older-family-members" target="_blank">Quora</a>. While drafting an answer to it, my thoughts went tangential, and the answer I drafted, ended up being something else. Since this was not an answer apt for the question, I felt like posting it somewhere else. The thoughts are mine, and the reasoning might be flawed, though I have tried to dissect and analyse the use cases. </p>


<h2>Why do some girls(single child or the youngest sibling) act like guys?</h2>
<br>
It can be because of two reasons:
<br>
 1. Their wishes have constantly been fulfilled, and they have been pampered a lot.
<br>
 

2. They have got into some sort of inferiority complex/unfortunate incidents and have survived it. Single Child might be lonely and wanting to express herself, and the younger sibling might have felt dominated by the elder one. 
<br><br>
Case 1:
<br>
When everything was perfect, the youngest sibling/single child gets all the love from the family, almost everyone is at her service, for even small things.
<br>
The basic human urge for more, can never stop, masculinity or tom-boyish nature is just an extrapolation of the dominance which they subconsciously develop for the reason that all their beck and calls have been addressed. 
<br><br>
Case 2:
<br>
If the younger sibling is not fortunate enough, and is bullied by the elder one(this might apply to the other children as well who are bullied), to every action there is equal and opposite reaction. If the child has been subjected to some incidents that would have left them feeling bullied and as a recovery mechanism they would have chosen to fight, rather than flight. Male being the dominant gender was the only choice that had been left, as a defense mechanism, resulting into a tom boyish nature.

Explanation<br>
==========<br><br>

Remember the last time you said to a friend "be a man" when you wanted him to be brave? By saying so you are actually telling him to be brave like a man and not a coward like a woman. Now if a woman heard you saying that then most probably her subconscious mind will store this piece of information and might make her think that women are inferior to men.

Symptoms might include - Short hairs, dressing like guys, more interested in activities that guys would be interested in maybe gadgets sorta. 
<br><br><br><br>
Further down the line towards extremes:<br>
=================================<br><br>

Anything that would remind the tomboy of her feminine nature will be unpleasant. That's why many tomboys love to wear black, prefer jeans to skirts, have guy friends, love gadgets and hate marriage.
<br><br>
Under the effect of the pressure some women get subjected to they start to believe that being a woman means that they are inferior, weak or less worthy than a man. This feeling will find itself in every women to a certain extent but for some women who were subjected to certain harsh environmental factors that feeling would be very intense.
<br><br>
Now when a girl starts feeling inferior because she is a girl one of two things will happen, she will either hate the fact that girls are weak or in more severe cases she will hate the fact that she is a girl.
<br><br>
If a girl hates the fact that she is weak then she will try to overcompensate by striving for power and status, she will get involved in guys' activities and even compete with them to prove her strength.
<br><br>
In more severe cases the girl might refrain from doing any activity that reminds her of her female identity to the extent that she might start developing excuses for not getting married. The girl in this case might not be aware of what's going behind the scenes as the feelings usually reside in the subconscious mind.
<br><br>
Anything that would remind the girl of her female identity will be a turn off, for example pink color, dolls, weakness in all forms and even commitment.
<br><br>
Buying a tomboy a teddy bear or a feminine gift might unconsciously be perceived as an insult. Those girls will like more things that have a touch of masculinity, for example a black or dark blue bag. 
<br><br>
Thats it, enough of analysis.
