      <p><em><a href="http://www.nif.org.in/">National Innovation Foundation</a> 
          has this competition called ignite, which mentors/promotes innovation
          of school children. <a href="http://www.nif.org.in/ignite/">more here</a>
          Dr. Kalam was here to award the selected participants from across the
          country and the excerpts from his speech  - </em></p>
      <hr>
      
      <p>The challenge, my young friends, is that you have to fight the hardest <br />
        battle, which any human being can ever imagine to fight; and never
        stop fighting until you arrive at your destined place, that is, a
        UNIQUE YOU! Conclusion Dear young friends, I am happy that the winners
        of the ignite competition have already shown how to be unique with
        original ideas and creative and inclusive thoughts. </p>

      <br><br>

      <p>Many of these ideas have become products ready to go to market and I
        am very happy that I see in front me thousand of potential innovators
        who will make India impatient with problems and spur it on the path of
        inclusive development. </p>
      
      <br><br>

      <p>Creativity is a process through which, we can continuously improve
        ideas and find unique solutions by making gradual alterations and
        refinements to our works.</p>
      
      <br><br>

      <p>Friends, recently I was addressing the Indian Science congress at
        Jammu and reminded them that they have to start thinking about
        creative ideas at an early stage in life.</p>

      <br><br>
      
      <p>Creative person has an attitude to accept change and newness, a
        willingness to play with ideas and possibilities, a flexibility of
        outlook, the habit of enjoying the good, while looking for ways to
        improve it.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p>Dimensions of Knowledge Society In the knowledge economy serves the objective
        of a society change from fulfilling the basic needs of all-round
        development to empowerment.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p>Creativity In a knowledge society, we have to make innovations
        continuously.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p>Creative mind has the ability to imagine or invent something new by
        combining, changing or reapplying existing ideas.</p>
