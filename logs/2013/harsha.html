<p>For the first time, saw Harsha Bhogle in person. What draws me most to him,
is his insightful articulation of Sachin, and of course those cricinfo
articles as well. He came with a presentation, this  article is a gist 
of all those slides, and the quotes, jokes and examples he delivered
during the talk at a short visit to the IIM-A campus. He was also
accompanied by the commentator Alan Willkins, who also happens to be a
great guy, he as well narrated couple of stories. </p>

<p>Contains few generic sentences as well, ignore per your wish. </p>

<h2>Be a part of a winning team.</h2>

<p>Showed it via the example of the two contemporaries
<a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/player/55988.html">Md. Ashraful</a> 
and <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/4578.html">Michael Clarke</a></p>

<p>How can I win the game vs. how can I save the game attitude.</p>

<h2>1% most of the times differentiates success and failure.</h2>

<p>Ricky Ponting was world's best batsman but he made sure he hits the
stumps it was his 1%. </p>

<p>Chasing the ball till the boundary lines, running the singles hard,
staying fit is 1%.</p>

<p>For Inzamam, running between the wickets was 1% which he did not do :-)</p>

<p>You need not worry too much about doing different things, rather than
doing simple things right. If you are being hit start bowling line and
length for the next 30 minutes. Remember Glenn Mc Grath. </p>

<p>Having read this, make a list of your 1% :-)</p>

<h2>Giving 100% every time is the only way to live life.</h2>

<p>We as Indians are obsessed with Jugaad. Its because we want the things
get done, whichever way, because that gives us the results and avoids
failure. Success is getting a century, but you don't score them, they
happen. Jugaad is the enemy of excellence, and vice versa. Take the
anxiety of the result away. You will enjoy the work and be more
productive. </p>

<h2>Adapt to all playing conditions.</h2>

<p>Remember why Dravid and Tendulkar are great, it is because they scored
runs overseas as well. There averages are similar irrespective of
playing conditions. This is why Sangakara is a better player than
Jayavardane. </p>

<p>On a lighter note, he mentioned true stories of Indian players getting
injured after taking a look at the bouncy pitches, because fast
bowlers are either angry or angrier. </p>

<p>"Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming
naked." - Warren Buffet</p>

<p>Seek adversity to see how good you are, for adversity is an
opportunity. </p>

<h2>Success is always in the context of time, space and scale.</h2>

<p>When you lose you analyze, when you win, you go for a drink. You need
to celebrate failure and analyze success as well, to some extent. 
If you don't know, why you have succeeded you won't be able to
replicate it. </p>

<p>What made you succeed in one environment, won't be the cause in the
second context. </p>

<h2>Resources vs Resourcefulness</h2>

<p>You should learn to make best of what you have, because you can't have
all that is required. Continuous improvement can take you there, the
initial size is not everything. </p>

<p>The story of Rohit Sharma. If talent is all you have, you are poor. 
Ability is no guarantee to success, its your work ethic, that takes
you there.  </p>

<p>Don't let <strong>what you can't do</strong> prohibit from doing <strong>what you can do</strong>.</p>

<p>Eg. Jonty Rhodes, used to say his average is much less than that of
Cullinan or Kirsten. But net-net he would save 20 runs in the field
and had an average of around 35, which made the net average of 55,
which in any given day is better than a batting average of 45 and
giving out runs by mis-fielding. </p>

<h2>Get out of your comfort zone</h2>

<p>"Out hone se itna dar lagta hai, run kaise banayenge." - Azharuddin in
a club match on couple of players. (They are so afraid of getting out, how will they score runs.) </p>

<p>What made you succeed is what you like doing, and you keep doing it
again and again. You become afraid of trying new things, because there
is a stigma attached with the failure. </p>

<p>The good thing about making mistakes is that, you make fewer mistakes
after making mistakes. So be glad about committing mistakes. </p>

<p>"I have made more mistakes than anyone in the broadcasting industry." - Harsha</p>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>Excellent people with individual egos will screw things. 
You need to dissolve personal ego, to build a better team. 
Clive Lloyd did a herculean job, he was able to manage egos, 
and that made the west indian team the best.</p>

<p> Personal Note : I came to know about it while going for the breakfast, accidentally in the morning, 
otherwise could never have met him in person. I was standing near the library, and he came in, said a "hi harsha" with a wink and smile, as if he were my friend, behind him was Allan Wilkins, thought of calling him Hi Allan Border(forgive the cheapness within, will never die ;-) but did not. Suhel Seth was also supposed to come, but it was good that he did not come. That flamboyant casanova, I don't like him.</p>
