  <br><br>
  <p><em>
  Its been long since I sat and wrote something. I want to sit and type like an animal, let the thoughts pour out on this white screen via the finger tips. The recent times, I had been living alone, and have got ample time to day-dream/reflect/think/analyze on much of the stuff that has happened around. I have been spending time on Quora and other QA sites. Sometimes questions on quora appear to be like  jokes, but when I have some doubts I do go and ask there(which might appear jokes to others, probably). This post is just a reflection of within, about the confusion regarding questions and questioning. Just speaking aloud all that's within.</em>
</p>
<br>
<p>
A quasi-dysfunctional being as me, does not need to showcase my engagement with pressing issues around me. Though, as of now, I am not filled up with negativism trying to justify myself. Leaving stuff apart lately I have observed, I tend to ask very basic and novice questions. The most recent/prominent of them being: Should I feel sad about the death of a close by? Should I be sad about not being sad? Probably someone might term it being too philosophical, but these are genuine doubts I have had. I tried asking it to people, and was given an alienating glance in return, meaning : this question is dumb, and you are stupid. Why does everyone assume that the inquiring mind is an idiot? I know the obvious and generic in most cases, what I am looking for is a realistic, well-informed, practical, detailed, and  insightful answer.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Most of the time I ask extremely basic questions, is for the reason that I want to get the perspective of the intelligentsia about a topic, and it will be fun brainstorming over it. I would love to see or find a group of people who are interested in getting together and banging heads and see what comes out. Even though the topic is out of context, one can possibly bring his lessons and skills and apply it to the new space. Group-mulling of ideas can be good, it is almost crowd-sourcing to point out loop holes within. Besides, some ideas may not lend to "socialization" because of their inherent nature. Helps to have them flagged -- if not decimated -- before you even begin. The group-mulling process need not be just one-way beneficial. The "mullers" stand to benefit from having their horizons broadened too.
</p>
<br>
<p>
This kind of mulling happens on Quora all the time, sometimes I like and the other times it kinda gets irritating.

<h2>Thoughts on when not to ask questions:</h2>

<p>
When the inquiring mind did zero research and asked a question so broad and so vague that it was impossible for anyone to answer it without months of work and very specific knowledge. To such question there might be thousands of sub-questions that need to be answered. Eventually so many that one might need some domain-specific people to ask and answer them. For such broad questions, probably none can help. Not because none wants to help, but because none can't. People can only speculate, and dig up some research. So its better to break down the problem, figure out which questions to ask, what information you don't have. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
 It's really hard to take a question like that seriously when it appears that the OP has put zero effort into researching the subject. How can you not be pessimistic about that? If you're not the kind of person that can do even the most basic research, then I don't have one iota of confidence that you would be successful in understanding the answer even when told. I'm not trying to be mean - just realistic. (The above gyaan applies to me as well, when I try to be lazy and am looking for jugaad/short-cut to some problem.)
</p>
<br>
<p>
It's asking other people to do your research for you. Asking questions without first trying to learn as much as your can yourself is a minor faux pas on the internet (witness all the 'let me google that for you' replies to elementary questions). Of course, this doesn't mean that asking questions is bad (not at all), but it means that there is generally a social contract at work. It's something along the lines of "I'll answer your question because I assume my effort won't be wasted."
</p>
<br>
<p>
So where have we reached at the end of the discussion??? 
Find a group, do some research work ask good questions, to which people can relate themselves and answer you. On the other hand, when a really novice question comes to you, don't treat it with a prejudiced mind. Try giving a li'l benefit of doubt to the OP on account of second order ignorance(you don't know, what you don't know). This will probably sort things :-)
