  <h1> Anurag Kashyap did his AMA session on reddit. I found it really good, so curated some of the content, to read when I feel like. </h1>
  <br>
  <p> TL;DR - Its a journey and it is enriching and beautiful unfortunately most people want to skip
that. (hence no TL;DR ;)</p>

  <h2>Tarantino has frequently maintained that he does not wanna direct
after reaching a certain age. Do you think that holds true for all
movie makers? Will you be doing this till you can?</h2>

<pre><code>Abhi to main jawan hoon.
</code></pre>

<h2>Is there any actor or actress that you would love to direct but
haven't yet got the chance?</h2>

<pre><code>Dilip Kumar
</code></pre>

<h2>Do you see yourself producing or directing a south indian film if it
has a good script or so?</h2>

<pre><code>I think we at PHANTOM are about to do that.
</code></pre>

<h2>What are some skills you would like to see in the upcoming directors
that you feel the current directors struggle with?</h2>

<pre><code>Storytelling.
</code></pre>

<h2>How would you define success for a director in our film industry?</h2>

<pre><code>*Success is what gives you freedom to be you.*
</code></pre>

<h2>What is a better way of showcasing or atleast getting a genuine
opinion for your work?</h2>

<pre><code>You keep doing them , and your work will one day take you wherever
you want to go. *Every opinion however critical is always good or
bad depending on how objectively you see it.* There are no
shortcuts.
</code></pre>

<h2>Your movies speak about a society that is bleak, ravaged and is
inhibited by people who are at war with their own selves. Have you
ever thought of exploring the concept of presenting a positive theme
in a new way, not in a formula based happy ending scenario but in a
direction which would make us viewers think about little nuances which
we missed in the theme while focusing on the bigger picture at life?</h2>

<pre><code>Someone else is doing that. I will do what matters to me at that
time. I would rather do a kickass comedy than do something with a
social message.
</code></pre>

<h2>Who is your favorite Indian director?</h2>

<pre><code>Guru Dutt
</code></pre>

<h2>Can you please provide pointers to your friend Imtiaz Ali on casting?
Lately he seems terrible at it.</h2>

<pre><code>He is not me and he is getting much much better at who he is. He
is on a whole different journey of rediscovery. Lets stop telling
people what to do and start by finding ourselves. and never NEVER
put the burden of our expectations on others. *What doesn't turn
you on, gives multiple orgasms to someone else.*
</code></pre>

<h2>Have you consciously become less approachable than you used to be?</h2>

<pre><code>Yes. I need to focus on my films. Earlier i was approachable
because very few approached me. Now its crazy. What I do matters
more to me. I have stopped producing and its the companies we
started which are doing them. I think I have done my bit for
others and now I need to be a very selfish filmmaker.
</code></pre>

<h2>As a comedian, I really really hope and wonder if you will ever make
an out and out comedy. Your sense of humour is so dark and so funny
that the idea of you doing a black comedy is delicious.</h2>

<pre><code>Been dying to do a comedy. also have a title "how to be a
capitalist via socialism"
</code></pre>

<h2>Is Udaan really the story of your life? How much does it resemble you?</h2>

<pre><code>Its 15% my life, 25% Vikram"s dad's life and 60 % the truth about
small towns.
</code></pre>

<h2>For how many years you had to struggle before you could achieve
something substantial in the film industry?</h2>

<pre><code>Struggle is only in the head and its constant. The external
physical struggle is not really a struggle, its a journey and it
is enriching and beautiful unfortunately most people want to skip
that.
</code></pre>

<h2>Why are the awards so wrong in India? I get that there need to be
 blockbuster entertaining movies but the awards should go to quality
 material. I remember Koi Milgaya (the alien film with Hrithik Roshan)
 won and Yuva by Mani Ratnam didn't. Is there any way to fix this? I
 was very surprised when Udaan won, how can the award ceremonies be
 fixed so they focus on quality (like they did with Udaan)?</h2>

<pre><code> Why do you want to fix it. The resentment generates more
 creativity. Their acceptance of all things brilliant will kill
 the joy of rebellion.
</code></pre>

<h2>My question is, are you apprehensive about delving into mainstream
cinema (as you have recently been doing) more deeply? And do you not
fear that you might lose the place that you carved out for yourself by
making offbeat cinema?</h2>

<pre><code>I have always believed I am mainstream. I just didn't have
stars. I will lose my place only if I start to get dishonest with
my film. If I start to cater to the fandom, either mine or the
star's fandom I will fail if not at first then sooner than
most. It does not matter who is in the film, what matters is why
you are making it and how honest are you to the material and to
yourself.
</code><strong>Read the above again!</strong></pre>



<h2>Did Paro actually slept with Sunil?(charectars in Dev D)    </h2>

<pre><code>Only Paro knows that. I dont think anyone knows a woman well
enough to know everything about her. We are the inferior sex to
them and lets live with that. I prefer that.
<strong> Read that Again! </strong>
</code></pre>



<h2>When you start writing a story (not screenplay) do you start with the
climax then go backwards or soul of the story or do you go with the
flow?</h2>

<pre><code>I just begin with writing scene 1. And see where it takes
me. obviously a lot of reading has gone into it beforehand. Go
with the flow. Like hemingway said - *Bleed*.
</code></pre>

<h2>When you go to a producer with a non romantic,unconventional story do
you get weird looks?</h2>

<pre><code>I am good with spinning circles around them, an art life teaches
you. I don't lie and they do not hear what they dont want to. Its
akin to I lie and they love me. The fact is no one knows what
works.
</code></pre>

<h2>Who is the most humble actor have worked with?</h2>

<pre><code>Amitabh Bachchan, Nowaz, Aditya Srivastav.
</code></pre>

<h2>Have you ever felt what you might be writing might not turn out great?
What do you do in order to keep on writing?</h2>

<pre><code>I just write. Masturbation is the biggest medicine to writers
block. I better all my writing while directing. Nothing will ever
be perfect and people who fear the imperfection should stop trying
to create. In order to create the perfect, you have to improvise on
the imperfect.
</code></pre>

<h2>There are theories about handful plots/ story lines being repeated
over time. How do you convince yourself that what you are writing will
be 'original' enough?</h2>

<pre><code>I don't try to be original. I just try to have fun and be "IN IT"
</code></pre>

<h2>Anurag, why do most of your films depict people in fringes of society?
And what is with the deal with the excessive use of swear words?</h2>

<pre><code>I love to explore the subcultures.. **There is more fun in the
forbidden than the obvious**. Whatever gives me the hard on I go for
it.
</code></pre>

<h2>I see a lot of similarities (blood, profanity, music, style) between
your films and Tarantino. Do you feel you have (consciously or
otherwise) been inspired by his films?</h2>

<pre><code>No. but yes Pulp fiction was a big influence on dialogue writing
of Paanch
</code></pre>

<h2>Would you be interested to make a hobbit or harry potter like movie?</h2>

<pre><code>Hobbit / harry potters can only be made in a language which is
universal so that it gets a bigger audience base to recover
costs. we are as big as the expanse of our language or our
translatability. small budget science fiction we can. maybe
someone will.
</code></pre>

<h2>If I had to see just one of your movies, which one would you recommend
? Which one are you the most proud of ? And why ?</h2>

<pre><code>always my next(recursion eh?)
</code></pre>

<h2>Could you tell me who your influences are?</h2>

<pre><code>start with scorsese
</code></pre>

<h2>Am not able to properly use these tools to create a good short... any
tips?</h2>

<pre><code>Look through your camera and really look. I guess you are always
looking into your own head and hence don't really see whats in
front of you, and when you are writing look with in. And best way
to write is to bleed.
</code></pre>

<h2>Would you rather fight a horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses?</h2>

<pre><code>A horse sized duck. it will be a fun fight. the other would be
irritating.
</code></pre>

<h2>What do you think about the current trend of making 'sequels' which
have no relation with the previous movie, if we follow this trend, all
Tim Burton and Johnny Depp movie could be sequels. This trend makes
the entire Hindi Film industry look immature.</h2>

<pre><code>To each their own. I don't tell them what not to do and will not
allow others to dictate me. film-making is also business and we
should not forget that if those films that make money are not made
then we also wont be allowed to make films. look at europe , the
countries that make only art house films have no industry are
dependent on the government and institutions for money and those
filmmakers get to make one film every six years unlike us who make
a film a year.
</code></pre>

<h2>How do you feel about movie piracy and that a lot of your movies are
 watched through torrent?</h2>

<pre><code> **I am thankful to piracy because it saved cinema and my career** and
 I get bothered by it too, that because of it our mainstream cinema
 now world wide has become only about summer blockbusters and
 superheroes and sequels. **Torrents have killed meaningful cinema
 worldwide because they are not like events and people chose to
 see them on laptops.**
</code></pre>

<h2>Have you ever considered telling your distributors, producers,
studios, etc. that people who legitimately buy media are not the
target audience of anti-piracy messages?</h2>

<pre><code>ignoring to answer other questions for obvious reasons (smart ;)
</code></pre>

<h2>Why do so many directors debut with critically acclaimed movies and
then go on producing average ones?</h2>

<pre><code>Because they realise how difficult it is to put a film
together. first films always give you the most freedom.
</code></pre>

<h2>Has the movie business become more director-influenced (vs. actor-influenced) over the past 10 years?</h2>

<pre><code>I hope it becomes more director driven/influenced.
</code></pre>

<h2>In movie making, what are the primary reasons for there being a theatrical cut and director's cut?</h2>

<pre><code>One is vanity ,the other business. i prefer vanity.
</code></pre>

<h2>When you're watching a movie, how do you know it's well directed?</h2>

<pre><code>When your jaw drops.
</code></pre>

<h2>How do actors handle themselves during sex/intimate scenes?</h2>

<pre><code>They are most terrified during those scenes and believe thats the
least turn on/sexy/ and most difficult thing to do. having sex on
camera is the most impersonal thing to do.
</code></pre>

<h2>How do actors cope with career uncertainty?</h2>

<pre><code>They have no choice but to deal with it, those who cant they
perish.
</code></pre>

<h2>What are the best resources to learn acting?</h2>

<pre><code>Figure it out yourself
</code></pre>

<h2>Some movies require simulated violent, degenerate, traumatic, and
repulsive acts, a role that is extremely arduous emotionally. Hows
does this affect actors/directors in their personal lives?</h2>

<pre><code>It does not. doing repulsive doesnot effect them because its fake,
it just looks real. what affects them is emotionally intense or
intimate scenes.
</code></pre>

<h2>How do you conceptualize the music for your films? Do you sit with the
lyricist and the music director to ensure that the music is coherent
with the narrative (I have found that the music in your films is woven
intricately with the narrative).</h2>

<pre><code>With Music I first look for the right person always a music
director who has an inclination to create than to deliver a hit
song and then he should have the time i need. Minimum we have
taken on any film to create music is 18 months. Bombay Velvet we
have already spent 4 years, gulaal we spent 3 years and Gow more
than 3 years. Music is developed simultaneously along with the
script is why they go together well. Lyricists are more often than
not chosen by the music director, he throws choices at me and I
respond as yes or know and we discuss the script at every stage
amongst ourselves. and whenever we pitch the film its always with
ready music. that also explains why I always work with a new music
director.
</code></pre>

<h2>How do you feel about the fact that most of the projects that you are
involved in don't belong to that "100 crore club". On a related note,
how do you gauge the success of your films?</h2>

<pre><code>I will care about the 100 crore club when my film costs more than
50 crore. like with my next BV needs to make more than that to be
sustainable for me in the future.
</code></pre>

<h2>How do people who live in countries where most Bollywood films are not
released get access to your films? Would an online distribution
schemes for Bollywood films be feasible? Maybe a pay to stream (once)
or something similar?    </h2>

<pre><code>Torrents zindabad(Hail Torrents)..other than that we are constantly trying to
break into foreign markets , with last few films we have managed
to do that in europe. we still need to crack US and UK
</code></pre>

<h2>Would you want to venture into mythological animation movies? If yes,
what would your favourite Indian myth character be?</h2>

<pre><code>Kaamdev(Guys he is serious! :)
</code></pre>

<h2>What is the one question that you wish an interview would ask, and
hasn't till date?</h2>

<pre><code>Would you like a drink?
</code></pre>

<h2>It is widely known that Script is the most important aspect in the
work you do. Have you in the recent past come across a script that
blew your mind but you know it is atleast a decade ahead of our times?
Even within your fan-base? Care to share a synopsis?</h2>

<pre><code>Yes the next film by Karan Gaur has a script much ahead of its
time. you would love it if you like Shane Carruth.
</code></pre>

<h2>You essentially have been a mentor to tons of new wave artists willing
and determined to make a difference to Indian Cinema. Do you feel a
strong sense of responsibility towards them, to see them grow to their
potential? Do you face a lot of criticism from your producers, friends
or family because of this?</h2>

<pre><code>I don't feel any responsibility, I do things because I enjoy them
or I just don't know how to say No to genuine passion and maybe I
am selfish. I see it as the only way to survive. More they exist
, longer I will get to make films.
</code></pre>

<h2>Any India centric issues /events/personality that come to your mind
you want to make a film on?</h2>

<pre><code>Sex lives of our politicians.. imagine those old fogies taking
viagra and sitting there waiting , looking down at it for it to
rise to the occasion backlit by the sun and then there is a crisis
and they have to go and they have to run and be in the middle of
it for the photo op and the viagra starts to take effect.. and
then he is giving a morality speech.
</code></pre>

<h2>What to you is the Quintessential Indian Indie/parallel/world
cinema. Where is it heading? Is it finding enough funding from
Production houses now, even for new film-makers? </h2>

<pre><code>I don't want to know where its heading, I am happy that it exists
and if we keep at it we will live and expand. supply and demand.
</code></pre>

<h2>Any Professional regrets you might have?</h2>

<pre><code>whats the point.. most regrets are personal
</code></pre>

<h2>How do you get past the censor boards?</h2>

<pre><code>Argue when they dont understand and make sure that your film is
powerful enough for them to let it go and honest to its milieu so
that it does not look like a cheap afterthought.
</code></pre>
