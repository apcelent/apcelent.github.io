<br><br><br>

  <p> <em> IIT KGP alum assoc Blore had their reunion sorta, and a movie made by one of its alumnus was being shown at National Gallery of Modern Arts Blore. 
  My uncle had invited me and so I escorted him. Please do *not* confuse this post to be a movie review. Just jotting down the experience of watching the movie and later having a discussion with the script writer+director+producer.</em> </p> 
  
  <p> About the movie - It was really good. Notable points:
  <ol>
  <li> Movie had couple of my favourite names -  Manoj Bajpayee, Nawazuddin Siddiqui,  Raj Kumar Yadav(kai po che), Barry John, and Piyush Mishra.</li>
  <li> As a photographer what I could observe was, the shallow depth of field towards the start, which grew later. It had a subtle impact on story lines, initially narrated by a kid who needs attention, but gains with the progress of the movie. (donno i might be doing some random observation)</li>
  <li> Movie was a beautiful story experience. Narrated by a growing kid, who had found a role model. The role model was a revolutionary. The main charecter dies but the seed thoughts which he had sown, brought results years later. </li>
  <li> You can read more about it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong_%28film%29" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> & 
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1785333/" target="_blank"> imdb</a> </li>
  </ol>

  <p> About the director+writer+producer: Super Awesome and Energetic Dude. Excerpts below:</p>
  <ol>
  <li> He graduated from IIT KGP, then did masters+PhD from columbia univ. then joined NASA in Jet Propulsion Lab. </li>
  <li> He has <strong> 87 patents </strong> to his name. Caltech sued some of the comapnies(Samsung, Canon) for using some of his patents which gave him 1.5 million USD which he used to produce the movie.  Intresting HUH!! Before this he went to people, to put in money but they did not listen to him.</li>
  <li> At the age of 45 he quit his job, to pursue his passion for movie.</li>
  <li> Quoting him - <ul>
  <li> I felt I would be a donkey, at the age of 70 being Chief Scientist, managing other scientists. So one day I decided to bring my digital processing research expertise, and my love for history and movies, the unsung stories in and around bengal. Thats how Chittagong came." </li>
  <li> On the first day of the set, I froze. 200 people looking at me for direction, and I did not know what to do. I jumped from a 100 storey building, but somehow was lucky enough to build a parachute and land safely.</li>
  <li> I regret having not diving into movies earlier. But having the NASA tag helped. </li>
  <li> "You are the most perfectionist director I have worked with" - Manoj Bajpayee</li>
  <li> I re-wrote my script 36 times. </li>
  <li> The effort required to reach from 90 - 95 is exponentially more than the effort required to reach from 85 - 90. It is that which brings perfection.  (In simple terms - As you approach perfection linear change in output requires exponential change in input.)</li>
  <li> Communism died, what good has capitalism brought in? People are capturing wall street, same happens in Greece etc. (This is slightly off topic, but worth pondering)</li>
  <li> In west, I see intellectuals, their house has collection of Dante's work, in India we don't have once gone through the works of KaliDas or Kabir for that matter. </li>
  <li> Knowledge vs Information </li>
  <li> In a smart/experienced tech team you don't manage PhDs you manage their egos ;) </li>  
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p> This was a movie, dedicated to his late son. Dad sang a song in the movie for his son. After the movie was over, you could see couple of hands busy wiping tears from their faces :)</p>
